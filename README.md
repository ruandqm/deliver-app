# deliver-app
#### Completion project for module 4 of the Front-End Web Development course with React by Flit.

### General:
This is a delivery system React project developed to practice our React skills and utilize cutting-edge technologies such as Axios, Yarn, Formik, Sass, DronaHQ, and Vercel. Although it's not yet complete, we're excited about the opportunities it presents. Feel free to check it out and give us feedback. Thank you!

### Specific Points:
The project consists of 4 pages in all, two of them developed together (Home and Requests) and two individual (restaurantMarcos and restaurantRuan).
#### Home:
- The categories filter categories are not static, they are taken directly from the products api.
- The layout is fully responsive and built with flexbox.

#### Requests:
- Requests are fetched from an api in dronahq and rendered on the page. This is the api: "https://apigenerator.dronahq.com/api/9x07oRHk/deliveryRequests"

#### Restaurant Pages:
- The first restaurant to be rendered will redirect to the page built by Marcos, the others will redirect to the page built by Ruan.

⚠️ Maybe not all functionality is working but we will work on it
